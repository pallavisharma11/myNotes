Q1:- what are microservices? what are the advantages? what are limitations?


Monolithic architecture :-
** multiple component are combined in single large app.
**Single Code Base.
**Deployed in single bundle.
**Change in one service then wholw app is redeployed.
**Building problem :- developer has to communicate.
**Cumbersome over time.
**Problem in scale.


Microservices:- 
**Large apps are  divide into small parts/project.
**Diferent codebase.
**Each module managed independently.
**Different tech stack.


Limitation:-
**Handling microservices is complex.
